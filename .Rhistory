### Packages
In this presentation we are using the packages:
'MASS', 'ggplot2', 'lubridate', and 'scales'.
Please first install 'ggplot2' and 'lubridate'.  'MASS' is installed automatically with the base installation of R. 'scales' may be installed with 'ggplot2' (not sure).
### Exploring what's in a Data Set
We use the Car fuel economy data from U.S. EPA available in the  package ggplot2
*What are the variables ?*  (Use  'head' and 'tail')
*What are the dimensions ?*
```{r  Exploring Data }
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)   # Car fuel economy data
head(mpg)   ##  head   gives the first 6 lines of the data
tail(mpg)   ##  tail   gives the last 6 lines of the data
dim(mpg)
```
### Summarizing with Tables and Graphs
* What is fl?
* Examine hwy  (highway mileage)
* Histogram
* Frequency Table / Bar Graphs
* Scatterplot
* Boxplot,  Conditioning Plot
```{r Summarizing and Graphing Part 1 }
