Working R Notes

-HHHR2 and UNH Pier datasets were imported into R
-column names were modified to "Week", "Date", "Month", "Day", "Year", "Station", "Alex", "Large PN", "Small PN", and "Chlorophyl", "PAR", "Temp", and "Salinity" in the UNH pier data.

-zeros in both dataframes were changed to 0.01 for each of working with logs

-Before continuing need to look at NAs and see if all of them are NAs or some are zeros
